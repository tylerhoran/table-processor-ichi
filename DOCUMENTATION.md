# Table Processor Documentation

## Overview

The Table Processor is a specialized tool designed to convert HTML tables into an LLM-friendly format. This document outlines the various approaches considered during development and explains why the hybrid approach was ultimately chosen.

## Problem Statement

HTML tables present several challenges when processed by Large Language Models (LLMs):

1. **Complex Structure**: Tables often contain merged cells, multi-level headers, and nested relationships.
2. **Visual Context**: Humans interpret tables by scanning both horizontally and vertically, while LLMs process text sequentially.
3. **Unknown Formats**: Tables can come from various sources (web pages, PDFs, OCR'd documents) with unpredictable structures.
4. **Accuracy Requirements**: Even small errors in interpretation can lead to significant problems in applications like building code compliance.

## Approaches Considered

### 1. Direct LLM Processing

**Description**: Send the raw HTML table directly to an LLM and ask it to extract the information.

**Pros**:
- Simple implementation
- No preprocessing required
- Can handle a wide variety of table formats

**Cons**:
- Inconsistent results
- High error rate with complex tables
- Expensive (each table requires an LLM API call)
- Slow processing time
- No guarantee of consistent output format

### 2. Rule-Based Parsing

**Description**: Create a set of rules to identify headers, data cells, and relationships based on HTML attributes and structure.

**Pros**:
- Fast processing
- Consistent output
- No LLM API costs
- Predictable behavior

**Cons**:
- Brittle to variations in table structure
- Difficult to handle complex merged cells
- Requires extensive rule sets for different table types
- May miss nuanced relationships

### 3. Grid-Based Approach

**Description**: Convert the HTML table into a 2D grid representation, then analyze the grid to identify headers and data relationships.

**Pros**:
- Handles merged cells well
- Preserves spatial relationships
- Works well with complex table structures
- Consistent output format

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- May struggle with deeply nested headers
- Requires careful handling of row and column positions

### 4. Hybrid Approach (Chosen)

**Description**: Combine grid-based representation with intelligent header detection and relationship analysis.

**Pros**:
- Robust to various table structures
- Handles complex merged cells effectively
- Preserves spatial relationships
- Produces consistent, LLM-friendly output
- Balances accuracy and performance

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation than direct LLM processing
- Requires careful tuning of header detection algorithms

## Implementation Details

The hybrid approach consists of several key components:

### 1. Parser

The parser converts HTML tables into a structured representation:

- Extracts headers and data cells
- Identifies merged cells and their spans
- Normalizes HTML attributes and content
- Handles both `<thead>` and header rows in `<tbody>`

### 2. Grid Builder

The grid builder creates a 2D representation of the table:

- Calculates grid dimensions based on spans
- Places cells in their correct positions
- Handles merged cells by referencing the main cell
- Preserves content and relationships

### 3. Header Analyzer

The header analyzer identifies and structures headers:

- Detects header rows and columns
- Identifies main headers vs. child headers
- Analyzes relationships between headers
- Handles multi-level header structures

### 4. Value Mapper

The value mapper associates data cells with their headers:

- Maps values to the appropriate headers
- Handles cells that span multiple header categories
- Creates a clean key-value representation
- Formats output for LLM consumption

## Why the Hybrid Approach Was Chosen

The hybrid approach was selected for several key reasons:

1. **Accuracy**: By using a grid-based representation combined with intelligent header detection, we can accurately process complex tables with merged cells and multi-level headers.

2. **Robustness**: The approach is more resilient to variations in table structure compared to pure rule-based methods.

3. **Performance**: Processing tables with our hybrid approach is significantly faster and more cost-effective than sending each table to an LLM.

4. **Consistency**: The output format is consistent and optimized for LLM consumption, making it easier for LLMs to understand and use the data.

5. **Scalability**: The approach can handle a wide variety of table structures without requiring extensive customization for each new table type.

## Tradeoffs and Considerations

During development, several tradeoffs were considered:

1. **Accuracy vs. Speed**: We prioritized accuracy over speed, as even small errors can lead to significant problems in applications like building code compliance.

2. **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: The hybrid approach is more complex than simpler approaches, but we've structured the code to be maintainable and well-documented.

3. **Generalization vs. Specialization**: We aimed for a general solution that can handle various table types, rather than optimizing for specific table formats.

4. **Output Format**: We chose a key-value format with clear separators between entries, as this is most compatible with how LLMs process information.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future improvement include:

1. **Enhanced Header Detection**: Improve algorithms for detecting headers in complex tables.
2. **Better Handling of Nested Tables**: Add support for tables nested within cells.
3. **OCR Integration**: Add preprocessing for OCR'd tables to clean up common errors.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the processing pipeline for faster results.
5. **Additional Output Formats**: Support for alternative output formats optimized for different LLM models.

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach provides the best balance of accuracy, robustness, and performance for processing HTML tables into an LLM-friendly format. By combining grid-based representation with intelligent header detection and relationship analysis, we've created a solution that can handle the complexity of real-world tables while producing consistent, high-quality output for LLM consumption.
